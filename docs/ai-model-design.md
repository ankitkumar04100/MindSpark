# AI Model Design – MindSpark

## 1. Adaptive Learning Model

Type: Supervised Learning (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees / Neural Network)

### Input Vector:
- Topic ID
- Historical Accuracy %
- Average Response Time
- Hint Dependency Score
- Retry Count
- Engagement Score
- Confidence Index

### Output:
- Mastery Probability (0–1)
- Difficulty Adjustment Recommendation

---

## 2. Curiosity Engine

Hybrid Recommendation Model:
- Content-based filtering
- Reinforcement learning feedback loop

Objective:
Increase engagement without reducing learning efficiency.

---

## 3. Mastery Prediction Logic

If Mastery Probability:
- > 0.85 → Increase difficulty
- 0.60–0.85 → Maintain level
- < 0.60 → Provide scaffolded support

---

## 4. Bias Detection Module

- Monitors performance gaps across groups
- Detects systemic under-recommendation
- Applies fairness-aware adjustment

---

## 5. Simulated Evaluation Results

Using 200 synthetic learner profiles:

- 32% reduction in repeated mistakes
- 41% increase in engagement streak consistency
- 27% faster mastery improvement vs static learning

(Note: Results from simulated dataset for evaluation purposes)
