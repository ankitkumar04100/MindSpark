# MindSpark Architecture

## 1. System Overview

MindSpark follows a modular, scalable, AI-driven architecture designed for adaptive, inclusive, and data-informed learning.

Architecture Layers:

1. Presentation Layer (Frontend – React + TypeScript)
2. API Layer (FastAPI Backend)
3. AI Intelligence Layer (Adaptive & Curiosity Engines)
4. Data Layer (User Profiles, Learning Analytics)
5. ML Training Pipeline (Model Optimization & Evaluation)

## 2. High-Level Architecture

Student → Frontend UI → API Gateway → Adaptive Engine → Decision Engine → Feedback Generator → Dashboard Analytics

Teacher → Dashboard → Analytics Service → Insight Engine → Reports
